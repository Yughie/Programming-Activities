Programming Exercise #2

(The Stock class) design a class named Stock that contains:


  > A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
  > A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
  > A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock price for the previous day.
  > A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the current time.
  > A constructor that creates a stock with specified symbol and name.
  > A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.


  Formula: ChangePercent = ((currentPrice - previousClosingPrice) / previousClosingPrice) * 100


Write a program that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol JAVA, the name Sun Microsystems
Inc, and the previous closing price of 4.5. Set a new current price to 4.35 and display the price-change
percentage
